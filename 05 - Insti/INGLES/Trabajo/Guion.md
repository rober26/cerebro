### **lide 1: Introduction**

> _“Hello, my name is Robert, and today I’m presenting **Technology in Education and the Future of Work**.”_

> _“In this talk, I’ll explore how digital tools — including artificial intelligence — are transforming the way we learn and the jobs we prepare for. We’ll cover homeschooling, educational platforms, AI in learning, LinkedIn Learning, digital inequality, and how we — as future professionals — can shape this future.”_

---

### **Slide 2: Homeschooling & the Pandemic**

> _“Homeschooling is legal in countries like the U.S., where over 2.9% of students study from home. It’s often chosen due to bullying, safety concerns, or for religious and academic reasons.”_

> _“However, in countries like Germany and Sweden, homeschooling is banned for socialization and curriculum control.”_

> _“In Spain, homeschooling exists in a legal ‘grey area’ — it's not fully allowed, but some families still practice it with legal loopholes or under private tutoring systems.”_

> _“During the pandemic, platforms like Zoom and Teams became essential. But digital gaps became visible: **70% of teachers** were not prepared for remote teaching, and many students felt lonely and unmotivated.”_

### **Slide 3: Educational Tools**

> _“This table compares some of the most widely used educational platforms, especially popular during the pandemic.”_

|Platform|✅ Advantages|❌ Disadvantages|
|---|---|---|
|Zoom|Breakout rooms|Zoombombing risks|
|Teams|Security tools|Complex interface|
|Moodle|Collaboration|Steep learning curve|

> _“These tools allow flexible learning, but they also require strong digital skills — both from teachers and students.”_

### **Slide 4: The AI Learning Revolution**

> _“Today, some people say AI makes us ‘lazy’ or replaces our thinking. But the truth is: AI is just a **tool**. Like a calculator or a book, it depends how we use it.”_

> _“We must ask AI to help us **understand**, not just give us answers. It’s not for cheating — it’s for learning smarter.”_

> _“AI tools like **ChatGPT**, **Khanmigo** from Khan Academy, and **Quizlet AI** help students ask questions, test themselves, and explore complex ideas in a personal way.”_

> _“You can also find AI tutors, grammar checkers, summarizers, and even tools that explain math step-by-step — available 24/7 and for free.”_

---

### **Slide 5: LinkedIn & LinkedIn Learning**

> _“LinkedIn is not only a platform to search for jobs — it’s a place to learn.”_

> _“With **LinkedIn Learning**, users can earn certificates in **AI**, **programming**, **business**, and even soft skills like communication and time management.”_

> _“There are more than 20,000 online courses, and the platform suggests skills based on your job goals.”_

> _“Tips: Keep your profile professional, show your personal projects, join industry groups, and ask for recommendations.”_

> _“Building a strong online presence today is almost as important as building a CV.”_

### **Slide 6: Digital Divide**

> _“But not everyone has the same access to this digital world.”_

> _“Some communities still lack internet, devices, or training. Many students in rural Spain or low-income areas fell behind during remote learning.”_

> _“If we don’t close this gap, technology can increase inequality instead of solving it.”_

---

### **Slide 7: Real Example (Computer Science)**

> _“As a future computer scientist, I see a huge opportunity — not just to code apps, but to create **ethical** and **inclusive** technology.”_

> _“For example: Open-source platforms like **Moodle** respect user privacy and allow customization — while corporate platforms like Google Classroom may collect data for advertising.”_

> _“We can build systems that protect student rights, support teachers, and adapt to individual needs — without selling user data.”_

> _“Technology should empower learners, not exploit them.”_

---

### **Slide 8: Key Recommendations**

> _“So, what can we do to improve education and work in the digital age?”_

1. 💻 Train all teachers in digital tools like Moodle or Edpuzzle
    
2. ⚖️ Create fair rules for online learning and job platforms
    
3. 🤖 Use AI ethically — as a learning support, not a replacement
    
4. 🌍 Invest in digital access for poor or rural communities
    

> _“This isn’t just about devices — it’s about **digital justice**.”_

### **Slide 9: Conclusion**

> _“In conclusion, technology is not the enemy — inequality is.”_

> _“We must use AI and online platforms to make education more open, flexible, and human. But we need policies and ethics to guide them.”_

> _“Let’s not ask ‘Will AI take our jobs?’ — let’s ask **how** we can use AI to create **better** education and more meaningful work.”_

> _“Thank you very much for listening!”_
